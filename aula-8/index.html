                    Once upon a time there was a lovely<br/>
                    princess. But she had an<br/>
                    enchantment upon her of a fearful<br/>
                    sort which could only be broken by<br/>
                    love's first kiss. She was locked<br/>
                    away in a castle guarded by a<br/>
                    terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to<br/>
                    free her from this dreadful prison, but non prevailed. She waited in<br/>
                    the dragon's keep in the highest<br/>
                    room of the tallest tower for her<br/>
                    true love and true love's first<br/>
                    kiss. (laughs) Like that's ever<br/>
